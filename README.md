# Simple openai api proxy server.

A new simulator code is implemented in concurrency_simulator.py
If try figute out that how this api server's performance on under free trial apikeys.
And here is my empirical result.
With one key of $5 and usage limit of 3 rpm, we need to get around 400 free trial apikeys in order to gain
a performance of 200 query concurrency and appoximate 20 generation ending throughout.
This is pretty cheap if you can get a good deal on free trial keys.
